      "     https://<nombre-recurso>.openai.azure.com/\n",
      "     ```\n",

      "   - En Azure OpenAI, la clave se obtiene desde el **Portal de Azure**, dentro del recurso *Azure OpenAI*.\n",
      "   - No es la misma clave que la de OpenAI “directo” (openai.com).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Configuración del SDK**\n",
      "   - En Azure normalmente se configuran variables como:\n",
      "     - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`\n",
      "     - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`\n",
      "     - `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Portal de Azure**\n",
      "   - Si puedes ver y administrar un recurso llamado **Azure OpenAI** en portal.azure.com, entonces definitivamente lo estás usando.\n",
      "\n",
      "Si quieres, dime:\n",
      "- Qué endpoint estás usando  \n",
      "- O un fragmento de tu configuración (sin compartir secretos)\n",
